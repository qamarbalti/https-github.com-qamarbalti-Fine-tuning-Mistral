# Fine-tuning Mistral 7B using QLoRA ðŸ¤™

Welcome!

In this notebook and tutorial, we will fine-tune the [Mistral 7B](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src) model - which outperforms Llama 2 13B on all tested benchmarks.

**Watch an accompanying video walk-through (but for using your own data) [here](https://youtu.be/kmkcNVvEz-k?si=Ogt1wRFNqYI6zXfw&t=1)!** If you'd like to see that notebook instead, click [here](https://github.com/brevdev/notebooks/blob/main/mistral-finetune-own-data.ipynb).

This tutorial will use QLoRA, a fine-tuning method that combines quantization and LoRA. For more information about what those are and how they work, see [this post](https://brev.dev/blog/how-qlora-works).

In this notebook, we will load the large model in 4bit using `bitsandbytes` (`Mistral-7B-v0.1`) and use LoRA to train using the PEFT library from Hugging Face ðŸ¤—.

Note that if you ever have trouble importing something from Huggingface, you may need to run `huggingface-cli login` in a shell. To open a shell in Jupyter Lab, click on 'Launcher' (or the '+' if it's not there) next to the notebook tab at the top of the screen. Under "Other", click "Terminal" and then run the command.

### Help us make this tutorial better! Please provide feedback on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/y9428NwTh3) or on [X](https://x.com/harperscarroll).

#### Before we begin: A note on OOM errors

If you get an error like this: `OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory`, tweak your parameters to make the model less computationally intensive. I will help guide you through that in this guide, and if you have any additional questions you can reach out on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/y9428NwTh3) or on [X](https://x.com/harperscarroll).

To re-try after you tweak your parameters, open a Terminal ('Launcher' or '+' in the nav bar above -> Other -> Terminal) and run the command `nvidia-smi`. Then find the process ID `PID` under `Processes` and run the command `kill [PID]`. You will need to re-start your notebook from the beginning. (There may be a better way to do this... if so please do let me know!)

## Let's begin!

I used a GPU and dev environment from [brev.dev](https://brev.dev). The whole thing cost me $1 using a 1xA10G 24GB. Click the badge below to get your preconfigured instance:

[![ Click here to deploy.](https://uohmivykqgnnbiouffke.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/landingpage/brevdeploynavy.svg)](https://console.brev.dev/environment/new?instance=A10G:g5.xlarge&diskStorage=256&name=mistral-finetune&file=https://github.com/brevdev/notebooks/raw/main/mistral-finetune.ipynb&python=3.10&cuda=12.0.1)

A single A10G (as linked) or L4 should be enough for this dataset; anything with >= 24GB GPU Memory. You may need more GPUs and/or Memory if your sequence max_length is larger than 512.

Once you've checked out your machine and landed in your instance page, select the specs you'd like (I used **Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.0.1**; these should be preconfigured for you if you use the badge above) and click the "Build" button to build your verb container. Give this a few minutes.

A few minutes after your model has started Running, click the 'Notebook' button on the top right of your screen once it illuminates (you may need to refresh the screen). You will be taken to a Jupyter Lab environment, where you can upload this Notebook.


Note: You can connect your cloud credits (AWS or GCP) by clicking "Org: " on the top right, and in the panel that slides over, click "Connect AWS" or "Connect GCP" under "Connect your cloud" and follow the instructions linked to attach your credentials.

Let's load a meaning representation dataset, and fine-tune Mistral on that. This is a great fine-tuning dataset as it teaches the model a unique form of desired output on which the base model performs poorly out-of-the box, so it's helpful to easily and inexpensively gauge whether the fine-tuned model has learned well. (Sources: [here](https://ragntune.com/blog/gpt3.5-vs-llama2-finetuning) and [here](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-is-for-form-not-facts)) (In contrast, if you fine-tune on a fact-based dataset, the model may already do quite well on that, and gauging learning is less obvious / may be more computationally expensive.)

`r` is the rank of the low-rank matrix used in the adapters, which thus controls the number of parameters trained. A higher rank will allow for more expressivity, but there is a compute tradeoff.

`alpha` is the scaling factor for the learned weights. The weight matrix is scaled by `alpha/r`, and thus a higher value for `alpha` assigns more weight to the LoRA activations.

The values used in the QLoRA paper were `r=64` and `lora_alpha=16`, and these are said to generalize well, but we will use `r=8` and `lora_alpha=16` so that we have more emphasis on the new fine-tuned data while also reducing computational complexity.

I used 500 steps, but I found the model should have trained for longer as it had not converged by then, so I upped the steps to 1000 below.

A note on training. You can set the `max_steps` to be high initially, and examine at what step your model's performance starts to degrade. There is where you'll find a sweet spot for how many steps to perform. For example, say you start with 1000 steps, and find that at around 500 steps the model starts overfitting - the validation loss goes up (bad) while the training loss goes down significantly, meaning the model is learning the training set really well, but is unable to generalize to new datapoints. Therefore, 500 steps would be your sweet spot, so you would use the `checkpoint-500` model repo in your output dir (`mistral-finetune-viggo`) as your final model in step 6 below.

You can interrupt the process via Kernel -> Interrupt Kernel in the top nav bar once you realize you didn't need to train anymore.
